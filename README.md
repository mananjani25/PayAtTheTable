# PayAtTheTable – Modern Tableside Payment Solution

**PayAtTheTable** revolutionizes the traditional restaurant checkout process by enabling fast, secure, and contactless payments **right at the customer’s table**.  
Instead of multiple back-and-forth steps between servers and terminals, guests can review their check, add a tip, and pay in seconds.

## 🍽️ Why PayAtTheTable?




The old way of settling a restaurant check typically requires **six slow steps**:

1. Server drops the check.
2. Customer places their card on the table.
3. Server takes card to a stationary terminal.
4. Server returns for tip and signature.
5. Customer signs and adds tip.
6. Server re-enters tip and finalizes the payment.

This process frustrates guests and wastes valuable staff time.
